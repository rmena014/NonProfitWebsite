      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        CRRH is a non -profit home organization in the Carolinas and we offers
        low-cost mortgages and down payment assistance for qualified home buyers
        whose needs are not met by the market. We finances the development of
        housing for people with special needs and provide foreclosure prevention
        assistance and access to housing counseling services. When working with
        CRRH you work with integrity and professionalism of our staff,
        management and partners. Here we do what we say we will do and manage
        resources wisely. There are quarterly meetings so our donors know how
        and where their hard earned money is going.
